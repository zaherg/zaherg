Greetings, I'm Zaher Ghaibeh, but you can call me â€˜za-herâ€™ (pronouns: [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he)). I'm a Syrian technophile and entrepreneur, currently soaking up the vibrant culture of Istanbul.

Fresh off the academic press, I earned my Master's in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management from Bahcesehir University, Class of 2022. But wait, there's more! I also boast a Bachelor's in Information Technology from the Syrian Virtual University (2009), a Diploma in Computing and Business Applications from the same institution (2006), and another Diploma in Information Technology from Damascus University (2003).


### The Professional Me
By day, I'm a senior backend who dabbles in full-stack development. My toolkit? A smorgasbord of cutting-edge tech, though `PHP` holds a special place in my heart. `Laravel`, `VueJS`, `LiveWire`, `AlpineJS`, `TailwindCSS`, and `Docker` are my trusty sidekicks in the digital realm.

### My Creative Ventures
Over the years, I've embarked on a few passion projects that have shaped my journey:

- **Msrofi**: In early 2010, my friend and I launched a personal finance SaaS venture. Though it was a product of its time and placeâ€”Syria in 2010â€”it had to be shelved in 2012 due to a myriad of financial challenges.

- **Building Web Applications Using Parse REST API**: Fast forward to 2015; I penned this book to share my experience using `Parse.com` as a robust data store for real-world applications.

- **Domain Book App**: In the summer of 2019, I crafted a macOS desktop application designed to be your digital domain Rolodex. Built with `VueJS` and `ElectronJs`, it's your go-to for keeping tabs on domain expiration dates.

- **Domains Book**: As of late 2022, I've taken Domain Book App to the [web](https://domainsbook.app)! This online version is engineered using `Laravel`, `Inertiajs`, `VueJS`, and `PostgreSQL`.
