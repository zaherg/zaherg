My name is Zaher ('za-her) Ghaibeh ([http://pronoun.is/he](http://pronoun.is/he)), Syrian living in Istanbul. I have graduated recently from [Bahcesehir](http://bau.edu.tr/) University with a Master's  in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management (Class 2022), also, I hold a Bachelor degree in Information technology (2009) & a Diploma in Computing and Business applications (2006) from the Syrian Virtual University, lastly, I hold also a Diploma in Information Technology (2003) from Damascus University.

On the professional side, I work as a senior backend (full-stack) developer and an entrepreneur. I love new shiny technologies (but I code mainly in PHP). I use `Laravel`, `VueJS`, `LiveWire`, `AlpineJS`, `TailwindCSS` and `Docker` in my work.

In Feb 2010, I built (with the help of my friend) and released the beta version of a SaaS product called [Msrofi](https://thenextweb.com/news/msrofi-com-easier-arabic-financial-decisions), a personal financial SaaS project, sadly we had to close it in 2012 due to many issues part of them were financial issues, remember this project was launched in Syria in 2010.

In 2015, I wrote a book called [Building Web Applications Using Parse REST API
](https://leanpub.com/building-web-applications-using-parse-rest-api), where I shared some tips of how to use `Parse.com` as a data-store for a real application.

In mid 2019 I built [Domain Book App](https://domainbook.dev), an easy and straightforward way to monitor your domains' expiration date. It is like a phonebook for your domains, it is built using `VueJS` and `ElectronJs`.

Currently, I am working as a freelancer helping other companies achieve their goals.
